Great job uploading it! 🔥
I went through your file, and here’s your **professional-style review**, just like how a real LaTeX mentor or client would give feedback.

I’ll divide it into:

1. **What you did well**
2. **What needs improvement**
3. **Corrections + suggestions**
4. **Your next micro-task before Exercise 2**

---

# ✅ 1. What you did really well

* ✔ You structured the report correctly
* ✔ You used mathematical notation confidently
* ✔ You included images and tables
* ✔ You used citations (good start!)
* ✔ Document compiles without errors
* ✔ Very neat and clean layout

You’re already working above beginner level.
For Exercise 1, this is a strong submission.

# ⚠️ 2. Areas to improve

These are NOT mistakes — just improvements that transform your LaTeX from *“student level” → “professional level”*.

### **(1) No title page / abstract page**

You used `\maketitle`, but a proper academic report needs a separate title page, often centered.

### **(2) Missing `\tableofcontents`**

You wrote the sections well, but clients expect a contents page.

### **(3) Hyperlinks should be colored and functional**

Right now, you added `hyperref` but you didn’t configure it.

### **(4) Equation numbering / referencing could be improved**

### **(5) Table formatting can be better**

Using basic `tabular` works, but intermediate LaTeX expects cleaner:

* column spacing
* header boldness
* centering vertically

### **(6) Images need size control**

Your image fits well, but later clients will ask:

* “make this exactly 0.8× text width”
* “align two images in one row”

So we’ll refine this.

# 🛠 3. Corrections + Improvements You Should Apply

I’ll give you exact snippets to improve your assignment.
(These are not required for the grade—just to upgrade your skills.)

---

## **(A) Better Title Page**

Replace your current title area with:

```latex
\begin{titlepage}
    \centering
    \vspace*{3cm}

    {\Huge \textbf{The Future of Artificial Intelligence} \par}
    \vspace{1cm}
    {\Large Kundhavai M \\ Department of Computer Science \par}

    \vfill
    {\large \today}
\end{titlepage}
```

---

## **(B) Add a Table of Contents**

Put this after `\begin{document}`:

```latex
\pagenumbering{roman}
\tableofcontents
\clearpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}
```

---

## **(C) Configure Hyperref**

Add this to preamble:

```latex
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks=true,
    linkcolor=blue,
    citecolor=teal,
    urlcolor=magenta
}
```

---

## **(D) Improve Table**

Use `tabularx`:

```latex
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{0.9\textwidth}{l X c}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Accuracy} \\
\hline
Linear Regression & Predicts continuous variables using linear combinations. & 85\% \\
Decision Trees & Hierarchical model with branching structure. & 92\% \\
Neural Networks & Multi-layer model for complex patterns. & 97\% \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Comparison of ML Models}
\end{table}
```

---

## **(E) Format Equations Using `align`**

```latex
\begin{align}
y &= mx + b \\
E &= mc^2
\end{align}
```

---

# 🎯 4. Your next *micro-task* before Exercise 2

**Update Exercise 1 with these 3 improvements:**

1. proper title page
2. table of contents
3. hyperref setup

These are small but essential improvements.

Once done:

> Send your updated repo link and say:
> **“Exercise 1 updated — ready for re-review.”**

---

# 🌟 Final Note

You’re progressing *exactly* the right way:
→ submitting
→ getting feedback
→ improving
→ moving to next exercise

This is the “professional feedback loop” that builds mastery.

Whenever you want, I’ll give you the Exercise 2 official specifications.
